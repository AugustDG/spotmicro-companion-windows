# spotmicro-companion-windows
 Companion app for my version of the spotmicro! If you want to have a look at that repository, you can check it out [here](https://github.com/AugustDG/spotmicro)!

This is meant as a quick Windows companion app for the _Bot_ to be able to easily control it through Bluetooth!

As I said on the accompanying repository, if you have any suggestions don't hesitate to raise an issue or send a pull request :D
